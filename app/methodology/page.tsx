          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Axesntra is designed to help users interpret public carrier data more consistently. The Axesntra scoring model does not rely on one metric alone. It evaluates multiple signal categories together — including maintenance, crash, driver, hazmat, trend, and administrative indicators — to identify carriers that may require closer review.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            The score is a decision-support tool. It is meant to help underwriters, brokers, risk managers, and transportation teams evaluate carriers faster and with more structure. It does not replace internal judgment, underwriting policy, or operational standards. It supports them.

            Each component contributes a weighted share to the overall carrier risk score. The weights reflect the relative importance of each category in predicting operational and safety exposure.

              <p className="text-sm text-emerald-800 leading-relaxed">
                The carrier&apos;s public safety and operating indicators are generally within acceptable ranges. No individual category is flagged as a primary concern. Trend direction is stable or improving. Low-risk carriers may still warrant periodic re-review, but they do not typically require immediate intervention.

              <p className="text-sm text-amber-800 leading-relaxed">
                One or more signal categories show elevated readings. The carrier may have above-average out-of-service rates, a recent uptick in inspection findings, or a worsening trend in a key area. Moderate-risk carriers deserve closer review and may be candidates for a watchlist, conditional approval, or additional documentation.
              </p>

            <div className="p-5 bg-red-50 rounded-lg border border-red-100">

              <p className="text-sm text-red-800 leading-relaxed">
                Multiple categories are elevated, or one category is significantly outside normal bounds. The carrier&apos;s profile suggests material safety or operating exposure. High-risk carriers typically warrant escalation, detailed review, or potential declination depending on the team&apos;s internal policy and risk appetite.

          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            A carrier&apos;s current metrics tell part of the story. Trend direction tells the rest. A carrier with moderate metrics today may be on a clear worsening trajectory. Another carrier with slightly elevated metrics may be actively improving.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            Axesntra calculates trend direction over a rolling 12-month window, weighted so that recent changes carry more influence than older data points. This helps surface carriers that are deteriorating before they reach a critical threshold, and gives credit to carriers that are making measurable improvements.

          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Public data has limitations. Not all carrier activity is captured in public records. Inspection rates vary by geography and enforcement patterns. Crash data may be incomplete or subject to reporting lag. Small carriers with few inspections may have less statistical reliability in their metrics.

          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            This scoring methodology is for internal screening purposes and decision support. It is not an official FMCSA safety rating, a legal opinion, an underwriting decision, or a guarantee of future carrier performance.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            Users should apply their own internal judgment, underwriting policy, and operational standards when making business decisions. Axesntra is designed to make that process faster and more consistent, not to replace it.
